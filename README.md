# Sudoku Game Final Project

Sudoku Game Project

By Alice Leppert

This will be a game with two difficulties, easy and difficult. You will get to choose which difficulty level you want at the startscreen. It will then give you a puzzle. You will have to solve each puzzle using numbers 1-9, a undo button, a check button, and a new game button. When you have finished, you can check your answers with the check button which will change the colors of the numbers to let you know if you got any wrong. If they are all right, confetti will drop from the top of the screen in celebration. You can get a new game by clicking the new game button, which will lead you to the startscreen again to choose a difficulty level.
