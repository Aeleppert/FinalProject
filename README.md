# Sudoku Game Final Project

Sudoku Game Project

By Alice Leppert

This will be a game with two difficulties, easy and difficult. You will get to choose which difficulty level you want at the startscreen. It will then give you a puzzle. You will have to solve each puzzle using numbers 1-9 on your keyboard, a clear button, which clears all answers, a check button, and the level buttons to start a new game once you have finished. When you have finished, you can check your answers with the check button which will change the colors of the numbers to let you know if you got any wrong.
